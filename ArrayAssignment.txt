1.What is the default value of Array for different data types.
   ans -- boolean -> false
          int-->     0
          double->   0.0
          String ->  null
user defined type-> null

2.Can you pass the negative number in Array size.
ans-- No, you cannot use a negative integer as size, 
the size of an array represents the number of elements in it, 
–ve number of elements in an array makes no sense.
Still if you do so, the program gets compiled without issues but, 
while executing it generates a runtime exception of type NegativeArraySizeException.

3.Where does Array stored in JVM memory.
ans--  The reference types in Java are stored in heap area. 
       Since arrays are reference types (we can create them using the new keyword) these are also stored in heap area.

4.What are the disadvantges of Array.
ans-- > once we create the size cannot be increased or decreased
      > It stores only homogeneous data elements.


5.What is an Anonymous Array in Java ?.Give an example.
ans-- > Aa array without a name is called Anonymous Array.
      > This type of array is create, just for instance use.    


6.What are the different ways to traverse an Array in java.
ans--  You can traverse through an array using for loop or forEach loop. Using the for loop − 
Instead on printing element by element, you can iterate the index using for loop starting from 0 
to length of the array (ArrayName. length) and access elements at each index. 


7.What is the difference between length and length() method?.Give an Examles.
ans-- Length is property of array where as length() is method  of String class.
